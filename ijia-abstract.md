Scholarly and public interest in the legacies of Islamic rule over the
territory that is present-day Portugal has surged since the 1990s. The
physical, cultural, and political evidence of Islamic presence in the
westernmost fringes of the Iberian peninsula, long discounted as a mere
'perturbation' [@romero:1906patria, 449] with respect either to later
Portuguese history or to the wider context of al-Andalus, have been
cast increasing light. Such major achievements as the research carried
out by urban archaeologists [@costa:2015mertola], the recovery of
Sephardic sites of memory [@barros:2019judeus; @prata:2017heranca], and
the study of the Arab housing compounds on the sites of later medieval
castles [@inacio:2009ensaio], sparked a golden age of medieval Islamic
archaeology in Portugal [@macias:1998portugal]. In addition to this
expanding archaeological picture, philological historiography has filled
in, with increasing detail, the subtleties of urban life and governance
in al-Andalus [@mazzoli-guintard:2000ciudades].

Although these new discoveries and interpretations have led to a
thorough reassessment of the history of medieval Portugal, they have
also obscured earlier musings on the Islamic roots of Portuguese
architecture. The  ethnographic and literary studies of the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, from Theophilo Braga in
Portugal [@braga:1870historia] to José Marianno Filho
[@mariannofilho:1943influencias] in Brazil and the Portuguese émigré to
Brazil, Ricardo Severo [@severo:1916arte], erected reminiscences of
Islamic culture into building blocks of national identity on both shores
of the Atlantic. These and other critics strove to acknowledge a
foundational role for Islamic culture in shaping the traditions of the
Portuguese speaking world.

This article explores the links between the concept of 'Mozarabism' in
the history and theory of Portuguese literature
[@martins:1953teoriaXXVIII], and the emergence of nationalist
architectural discourses promoting the appropriation of Islamic
traditions. This relationship between literature and architecture arises
out of Romanticist historical fiction [@almeidagarrett:1844miragaia] as
a justification for a hedonistic 'architectural Orientalism'
[@oulebsir:2009orientalisme]. As with *andalucismo* in Spain, however,
the Portuguese and Brazilian ability to leverage Islamic heritage within
a nationalist narrative ultimately hinges on these nations' quite
serious efforts at their own 'anthropological nation-building'
[@leal:2006tylorian, 111]. Though nationalist 'Mozarabism' wanes
precisely during the heyday of Portugal's and Brazil's far right,
nationalistic régimes in the 1930s, it lays the foundations for the late
twentieth century awareness of a pan-Mediterranean culture
[@costa:2015arquitetura] and of climate sensitive architecture
[@paulo:2008pequena].
