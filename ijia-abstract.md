Scholarly and public interest in the legacies of Islamic rule over the
territory that is present-day Portugal has surged since the 1990s. The
physical, cultural, and political evidence of Islamic presence in the
westernmost fringes of the Iberian peninsula, long discounted as
inconsequential with respect either to later Portuguese history or to
the wider context of al-Andalus, have been cast increasing light. Such
major achievements as the research carried out by the Archaeological
authority of the city of Mértola, the recovery of Sephardic sites of
memory throughout southern Portugal, and the study of the Arab palace on
the site of the present-day Lisbon castle ruins, sparked a golden age of
medieval Islamic archaeology in Portugal. In addition to this expanding
archaeological picture, historiography has filled in, with increasing
detail, the subtleties of urban life and governance in al-Andalus.

Although these new discoveries and interpretations have led to a
thorough reassessment of the history of medieval Portugal, they have
also obscured earlier musings on the Islamic roots of Portuguese
architecture. The  ethnographic and literary studies of the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, from Theophilo Braga in
Portugal to José Marianno Filho in Brazil, erected reminiscences of
Islamic culture into building blocks of national identity on both sides
of the Atlantic. Yet, these and other critics, making the best out of
the archaeological and philological means of their age, struggled with
then prevailing Western racial hierarchies to acknowledge a foundational
role for 'Mozarabic' culture in shaping the traditions of the Portuguese
speaking world.
